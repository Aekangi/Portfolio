My previous experience as a baker has taught me how to appreciate every component that goes into making a masterpiece â€” and how to do that while working collaboratively with others in fast-paced, deadline-driven environments. Coder by day and baker by night, I am excited to contribute my skills in team management, designing, and coding with my adaptability, creativity, and people skills to help companies solve problems and achieve their goals.";
